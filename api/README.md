# Worker API

This directory will hold the Cloudflare Worker that powers ingestion, generation, and library APIs.

## Next steps

- Create the Worker entry point (e.g., `src/index.ts`).
- Define REST routes for transcripts, generation, and catalog search.
- Wire up D1, R2, Vectorize, and Workers AI bindings.
