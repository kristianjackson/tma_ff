# Frontend (React + TypeScript)

This directory will hold the Cloudflare Pages frontend for the Magnus Institute — North American Repository.

## Next steps

- Scaffold the React Router app (e.g., `npm create cloudflare@latest` with the Pages + React Router template).
- Add Tailwind CSS and design the generation dashboard.
- Implement routes for ingestion, generation, and library views.
